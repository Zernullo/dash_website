# Backend Structure Guide (For Beginners)
This explains what all these folders and files do in our backend.


## üè† Main Files
1. `app.ts` - The "boss" of our app. It sets up all the basic rules.
   - Like: How to handle requests, security rules, etc.
   
2. `server.ts` - The "starter". It turns on our server and connects to database.


## üìÇ Folders and What's Inside
### 1. `config/` - Settings
- `index.ts` - All important settings in one place
  - Database connection info
  - Secret keys
  - Server port number

### 2. `controllers/` - Traffic Directors
- `exampleController.ts` (you'll rename this)
  - Decides what to do when someone visits a URL
  - Example: If someone goes to `/login`, this handles it

### 3. `middlewares/` - Security Guards
- `errorHandler.ts` - Catches and handles errors nicely
- `auth.ts` - Checks if users are logged in

### 4. `models/` - Data Shapes
- `exampleModel.ts` (you'll rename this)
  - Defines what our data looks like
  - Example: A "User" has name, email, password

### 5. `routes/` - Road Signs
- `exampleRoutes.ts` (you'll rename this)
  - Maps URLs to controllers
  - Example: "/login" ‚Üí loginController
- `index.ts` - Combines all routes together

### 6. `types/` - Labels
- `customTypes.ts` - Extra labels for our data
  - Helps TypeScript understand our special data shapes

### 7. `utils/` - Helpers
- `logger.ts` - Writes down what's happening
- `apiFeatures.ts` - Tools for working with APIs


## Other Important Files
- `.env.example` - Template for secret settings (copy to `.env` for real use)
- `.gitignore` - Tells Git what files to ignore


## üåü How It All Works Together
1. Someone visits your website ‚Üí 
2. `server.ts` starts everything ‚Üí 
3. `app.ts` sets up the rules ‚Üí 
4. `routes/` sends them to the right place ‚Üí 
5. `controllers/` decide what to do ‚Üí 
6. `models/` talk to the database ‚Üí 
7. Response goes back to the user!


## üí° Tips
- Rename all "example" files to what they really are (like "userModel.ts")
- Add new files when you need new features
- Don't panic - it's just files talking to each other!
- Also REMEMBER this is just a prototype/Templete of Mern Stack, you can always use this for future Mern Stack Projects. **The only thing I wrote myself :/


`I set up a basic hello world currently`
# How to run the program (Use Command Prompt)
`Terminal 1:`
cd backend
npm run dev
ctrl click link

`Terminal 2:`
cd frontend
npm run dev
ctrl Click link

Backend Server: localhost:5000 
Should print `Hello World from backend!`

Frontend Server: localhost:5173
Should print  `Hello from frontend!`
              `Backend says: Hello World from backend!`
